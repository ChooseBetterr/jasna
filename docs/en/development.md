# Running from Source

This page is for developers. To just use Jasna, download a release package: it
bundles its own Python/Tk runtime, `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`.

The public checkout runs the GUI, CLI and free **BasicVSR++** without the private
protection module. Activation and encrypted **unet-4x**, **SD 1.5** and **LTX**
models require the official release. LTX trial mode uses random weights and
does not restore videos. A missing private module disables activation; errors
inside an installed module still report a failure.

## Requirements

- Python **3.12+** (releases ship 3.13 on NVIDIA, 3.12 on AMD).
- `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` **8** on `PATH`.
- libVLC 3 for GUI player audio (Ubuntu: `libvlc5 vlc-plugin-base`).
- Optional, NVIDIA: the CUDA 13 toolkit (`nvcc`), a C++ compiler `nvcc` accepts and
  `ninja` (in the `dev` extra) build the native LTX block on first use (see
  [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)); without them LTX runs its `torch.compile` path.
- Optional, NVIDIA: a `python_vali` wheel built from
  <https://codeberg.org/Kruk2/vali> (needs CUDA 13, `cmake`, `ninja`; on
  Windows also VS Build Tools 2022 with C++). Without that fork the decoder
  falls back to PyAV for every video.

## NVIDIA

Create the venv from your distribution's Python, whose Tk uses Xft. A
standalone Python with a `no-xft` Tk renders every GUI font as bitmap `fixed`.

```bash
uv venv --python /usr/bin/python3.13 --no-managed-python --no-python-downloads .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[nvidia,dev]" --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
```

Ubuntu 22.04 has no Python 3.13 package; build one against `tk-dev` and
`libxft-dev`.

On Windows (NVIDIA), run the same `uv pip install` line in a Python 3.13 venv.

## AMD (ROCm 10.0)

Linux: work inside the `rocm/pytorch` ROCm 10.0 image (torch comes from the
image), then `uv pip install -e ".[amd,dev]"`.

Windows (Python 3.12, Adrenalin 26.8.1 or newer): install torch from AMD's
index **first**, otherwise a later dependency pulls the CPU torch from PyPI:

```powershell
$I = "https://stable.repo.amd.com/rocm/whl-next/"
$D = "device-gfx1100,device-gfx1101,device-gfx1102,device-gfx1103,device-gfx1150,device-gfx1151,device-gfx1200,device-gfx1201"
pip install --index-url $I "torch[$D]==2.12.0+rocm10.0.0" "torchvision[$D]==0.27.0+rocm10.0.0"
uv pip install -e ".[amd,dev]"
```

Check that ROCm stuck (an unsatisfiable torch pin makes uv silently install the
CUDA build, which breaks RF-DETR):

```bash
python -c "import torch, torchvision; assert torch.version.hip and '+rocm' in torchvision.__version__; print('ROCm OK')"
```

A new GPU target needs its `device-gfx*` extra above and in the
`Dockerfile.amd` keep-list.

AMD runs RF-DETR as the `rfdetr` torch model and decodes/encodes with AMF
(software decode when AMF can't). Secondary restoration is NVIDIA-only.
`--device cuda:N` picks the GPU, but FFmpeg 8's Linux AMF ignores the adapter,
so isolate the GPU at the container or host level on multi-GPU machines.

## Run

```bash
python -m jasna                                    # GUI
python -m jasna --input in.mp4 --output out.mp4    # CLI (see docs/en/cli.md)
```

`JASNA_DECODE_BACKEND=vali|pyav-hw|pyav-sw` forces a decoder; the default
`auto` prefers VALI on NVIDIA.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

GUI tests need a screen; on a headless or locked desktop run them under
`xvfb-run -a`. GPU tests need the matching GPU.

## CUDA kernels

`jasna/media/*.cu` are prebuilt into the committed `.fatbin` files next to
them, so running Jasna needs no CUDA toolkit. After editing a `.cu`, rebuild
with CUDA 13 and `g++-15` (override with `CCBIN=`):

```bash
scripts/build_fatbins.sh        # every kernel
scripts/build_fatbins.sh cas    # just jasna/media/cas.cu
```

Add a new fatbin to `CUDA_KERNEL_FATBINS` in
`jasna/protection/keytool/build_nuitka.py`. Every kernel needs a Torch
equivalent: ROCm uses it, and the tests use it as the reference.

## Benchmarks

Run by the maintainer only, on an otherwise idle GPU. Inputs live in the
gitignored `assets/benchmark/`. Write results to
`benchmarks/<date>_<topic>.{csv,md}` and never edit an old CSV.

The release suite is one H.264 input per resolution plus the 8K VR clip,
median of three runs, with `--max-clip-size 180 --temporal-overlap 15
--secondary-restoration none`. Add `--codecs` (HEVC 10-bit and AV1) when the
change touches decode, encode or pixel formats; H.264 hides decode differences.

```bash
scripts/run_benchmarks.sh benchmarks/scratch [--codecs] [--scan]       # ~8 min
P=~/.virtualenvs/jasna-linux/bin/python
$P scripts/benchmark_decode_backends.py --backends vali pyav-hw pyav-sw   # e2e per decoder
$P scripts/benchmark_scan_backends.py --backends vali                     # GUI mosaic scan
$P scripts/benchmark_releases.py --release v0.9.0=/path/to/jasna --source HEAD=. --workdir WORKDIR/releases --csv out.csv
$P scripts/benchmark_lada_flatpak.py --workdir WORKDIR/lada --csv out.csv   # Lada baseline
$P scripts/benchmark_ltx_denoise.py --model undistilled --csv out.csv    # LTX denoise, trial weights
$P scripts/benchmark_ltx_decode.py --variants shipped,kitchen,eager      # LTX VAE decode
$P scripts/benchmark_na3d.py                                             # Triton NA kernel
```

`scripts/bench_memory.py` is the RAM/VRAM sampler the others share.

Source-mode LTX runs the public native block (`jasna/ltx/native/`: one C++/CUDA
call per transformer block, built on first use into the compile cache, ~1-2 min)
when the toolchain is there and the GPU is in the kernel tables, else the
`torch.compile`/Triton path; `JASNA_LTX_NATIVE=0` forces `torch.compile` for an
A/B in one tree. `jasna.ltx.native.prebuild(dir)` builds the extension and the
cubins of every table architecture for a release (copy `dir` to
`jasna/ltx/native/prebuilt/`). NVIDIA frozen releases keep licensed blocks behind
the private native `block_forward` boundary; they do not expose protected
per-Linear operators. Changes to any path must compare identical weights, inputs,
seeds and warmed caches. The public native block is GPU-qualified on SM 12.0
(RTX 5090) and SM 8.6 (RTX 3090, INT8 only, plain Triton GEMMs since Ampere has
no TMA for stream-K); cubins for another SM do not by themselves establish support.

## Release checklist

1. Same version in `pyproject.toml`, `jasna/__init__.py`, the git tag and
   `RELEASE_SOURCES.md`; that file must match the PyAV, VALI, FFmpeg, Python
   and protection revisions used by the build.
2. The unpacked package contains `LICENSE`, `LICENSING.md`, `NOTICE`,
   `RELEASE_SOURCES.md`, `assets/THIRD_PARTY_*.md` and `licenses/`.
3. Every bundled model hash matches `assets/THIRD_PARTY_MODELS.md`.
4. Upload every archive part **and** its `.sha256` to the same GitHub release.

Release builds (NVIDIA and AMD) live in the private protection submodule
(`jasna/protection/keytool/`).
