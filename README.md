# <img width="32" src="https://github.com/Kruk2/jasna/blob/main/assets/jasna-logo.png?raw=true" /> Jasna 

Jasna restores mosaics in JAV videos and images. It has a simple GUI and a
command line, and runs fully on the GPU (NVIDIA, or AMD as experimental).

Jasna is free. Supporters get a License code for extra models trained for this
project: the **unet-4x** upscaler and the experimental **SD 1.5** image model
for $15 USD, or both plus the **LTX** restoration model for $25 USD. See
[Supporting the project](#supporting-the-project).

## What Jasna Does

- Restores mosaics in videos, and in images with the SD 1.5 model.
- Finds mosaics with the fast `rfdetr-v6` model. Other detection models are
  available too (bigger RF-DETR, Lada YOLO, ZeLeFans).
- Two restoration models: fast **BasicVSR++** (default, free) and slow but
  more detailed [LTX](docs/en/models.md#restoration-model) (paid, NVIDIA
  only).
- Optional [secondary restoration](docs/en/models.md#secondary-restoration)
  makes restored areas sharper, mostly on big mosaics and 4K (NVIDIA only):
  **unet-4x**, **RTX Super Resolution** or **Topaz Video AI**.
- Handles VR180 side-by-side videos per eye, with settings picked per studio.
- **Segment Editor**: restore only some parts of a video, scan for mosaics,
  preview the result, and choose a model per range.
- Smooth clip borders (overlap and crossfade) and no mixing across scene cuts.
- **Video Player**: watch a video restored live, without making a file.
- Streaming to your browser or to a [Stash](docs/en/streaming.md#stash)
  version made for Jasna.

## Community

Join the [SLS Discord](https://discord.gg/uNwQ4mHqgv) for examples, help and
settings. Please don't be too weird.

## Requirements

- NVIDIA **GTX 16-series / RTX 20-series or newer**. GTX 10-series and older
  (GTX 1050/1060/1070/1080) don't work. Not sure? Your GPU needs compute
  capability 7.5 or higher in NVIDIA's
  [GPU table](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/gpus).
- NVIDIA driver **610 or newer** on Windows, **580 or newer** on Linux.
- AMD (experimental): a GPU supported by ROCm (Radeon RX 7000/9000, Radeon
  780M/760M/740M, Ryzen AI). On Windows, AMD Adrenalin driver 26.8.1 or newer.
- Install Jasna in a folder whose path has only English letters and numbers,
  on a local disk: NTFS on Windows, ext4, Btrfs or XFS on Linux.
- LTX needs more. See [What LTX needs](docs/en/models.md#what-ltx-needs).

## Quick Start

1. Download the release for your system and GPU.
2. Unpack it into a folder with only English letters in the path.
3. Start the app:
   - Windows: double-click `jasna.exe`.
   - Linux NVIDIA: run the `jasna` file.
   - Linux AMD: run `run_jasna_amd.sh`.
4. Add a video or image, choose settings and click Start.

The first start takes longer. A loading window shows the installation check
before the main window opens.

On Windows, Jasna's temporary files can also be on an NTFS RAM disk such as
ImDisk. See [Windows temporary files](docs/en/cli.md#windows-temporary-files).

Every setting has a tooltip: move the mouse over the ⓘ icon. The
[GUI guide](docs/en/gui.md) explains the rest: the queue, presets, output
names, the Video Player and more.

Command line:

```bash
# One video
jasna --input input.mp4 --output output.mkv

# One image
jasna --input photo.png --output restored.png

# A whole folder
jasna --input input_folder --output output_folder
```

`jasna --help` lists all options. More in the [CLI reference](docs/en/cli.md).

## First Run

The first job is slow, because Jasna prepares files for your exact GPU. On
NVIDIA this takes about **15–60 minutes**, on AMD much less. It happens only
once. The files are saved in `model_weights` and used again later. You can
copy them from an older Jasna version to a newer one.

Close other apps, also the browser, and don't use the PC during this time.

Out of VRAM during a job? Lower **max clip size** first, for example from `90`
to `60`. See [Tuning VRAM and GPU usage](docs/en/tuning.md).

## Benchmarks

Time to restore a whole video, BasicVSR++ with default models, on an RTX 5090
(Linux), compared with Lada. Lower is better. The test clips are 3:22 long,
the 8K VR clip is 15 s.

## Licensing

Jasna's public application source is AGPL-3.0. Models and bundled dependencies
retain their own terms. See [licensing and source availability](LICENSING.md),
[model notices](assets/THIRD_PARTY_MODELS.md), and the
[release source correspondence](RELEASE_SOURCES.md).

## Supporting the Project

Your support pays for training new models, mostly GPU rental for bigger
datasets. Paid models:

| Support | Models |
| --- | --- |
| **$15 USD** or more in total | **unet-4x**: secondary upscaler, sharper results (256 → 1024).<br>**SD 1.5**: experimental model for still images. |
| **$25 USD** | **unet-4x** and **SD 1.5**, plus<br>**LTX**: much slower than BasicVSR++, but more detail. NVIDIA only. Includes future updates of this LTX model. |

Supporters who gave **$15 USD or more before [TBD]** get LTX for free.

**Before you buy LTX:**

- Look at the samples in the
  [SLS Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1196376491815092265/1199059436199759943).
- Run LTX in **Trial mode** on your PC. It is free and shows if your GPU can
  run LTX and how long it takes. The video is not restored. See
  [What LTX needs](docs/en/models.md#what-ltx-needs).

More examples:

- [unet-4x / secondary restoration on SLS Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1196376491815092265/1199059436199759943/1516497879684874260)
- [SD 1.5 image restoration on SLS Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1196376491815092265/1199059436199759943/1492139124348420106) and [more SD 1.5 examples](https://discord.com/channels/1196376491815092265/1199059436199759943/1516571355317800990)

### Where to buy

License codes are sold **only** here:

- [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/kruk2) (crypto works too)
- [Unifans](https://app.unifans.io/c/kruk2)
- For China: see the [Chinese README](README.zh.md#在闲鱼购买)

Anyone else selling Jasna, codes or modified files is a scam: their keys don't
work, and their files can run hidden code on your PC. Download Jasna only from
GitHub.

### How to activate

1. Buy on one of the pages above. You get a **License code**.
2. In Jasna, open **Activate Jasna**, enter the License code and press
   **Activate online**.
3. No internet on that PC, or it fails? Choose **Manual**, see
   [Activate paid models](docs/en/gui.md#activate-paid-models).

One License code works on **3 PCs or cloud workspaces**. Activation is checked
offline after that. Rented GPUs: see [Cloud GPUs](docs/en/cloud.md).

## Acknowledgments

- **[Lada](https://codeberg.org/ladaapp/lada) (Codeberg)**: Jasna is inspired
  by Lada and in some places based on it. The `mosaic_restoration_1.2` model
  used by Jasna was trained by ladaapp, the author of Lada.
- **ZeLeFans**: for the VR detection model and the detailed analysis of mosaic
  shapes and VR projection.

## TODO

Current TODO:

- SeedVR support?
- Continued performance and VRAM improvements.
- Better restoration model.
- Better detection model.
